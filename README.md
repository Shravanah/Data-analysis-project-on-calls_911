# calls_911
Welcome to the repository for my Data Analysis and Visualization project centered around 911 emergency calls. This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset containing information about the reasons for the calls, number of calls per day and many more.
In this project I have used pandas for data handling, data cleaning, data manipulation and finally for exploratory data analysis. 
Further I have imported seaborn and pyplot from matplotlib for better data visualization and have plotted clustermap and heatmap to provide a visual representation of the clustering results, which can be valuable for data interpretation and decision-making, countplot to represent the frequency of each reason to call and also to show the distribution of the calls each day of the week. Then I determined the linearity of the graph between each month and township and many other plots for better understanding of the given data. 
In conclusion, from this project we can learn how to deal with differnt datasets.
